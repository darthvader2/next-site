We’ve populated the index page with the blog data, but we still haven’t created individual blog pages yet (here’s the [the desired result](https://next-learn-starter.now.sh/)). We want the URL for these pages to depend on the blog data, which means we need to use dynamic routes.

### What You’ll Learn in This Lesson

In this lesson, you’ll learn:

- How to statically generate pages with dynamic routes using `getStaticPaths`.
- How to write `getStaticProps` to fetch the data for each blog post.
- How to render markdown using `remark`.
- How to pretty-print date strings.
- How to link to a page with dynamic routes.
- Some useful information on dynamic routes.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
